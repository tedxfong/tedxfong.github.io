## About Me

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Nanovision Technology at Shizuoka University in Hamamatsu, Japan. My research focuses on **biomedical imaging** and **high dynamic range (HDR) imaging** using **multi-tap CMOS image sensors**.

## Languages

ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§Â **English:** Fluent (TOEIC 990) | ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µÂ **Japanese:** Fluent (JLPT N1) | ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³Â **Chinese:** Native

## Research Interests

- **CMOS Image Sensors:** Sensor design and characterization, imaging system integration, image signal processing  
- **Biomedical Imaging:** Spatial frequency domain imaging (SFDI), non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging, motion artifact mitigation, ambient light bias mitigation  
- **HDR Imaging:** Charge-splitting, LED flicker mitigation (LFM), motion artifact mitigation (MAM)
